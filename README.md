# TPG-widget
Archived copy of an old [https://www.imore.com/mac/macos/a-history-of-widgets-on-the-mac-from-dashboard-to-desktop](Mac OSX widget) I created in 2008 to track bandwidth usage for Australian ISP [TPG](https://www.tpg.com.au)

Needless to say, this is all very outdated now and no longer works, but I'm keeping it here for posterity.
